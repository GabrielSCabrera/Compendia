## Gabriel's Compendia

As an undergraduate of Physics at the University of Oslo, I have found that it is often difficult to approach some of the topics in our course literature due to:

- Unintuitive Explanations

- Cluttered Information

- Content Dilution from Examples

Although examples are vital to understanding a subject, I find that it is very useful to have the curriculum of a course independent of such examples since it allows for a better overall understanding of a subject due to the fact that it allows for:

- Clearer Context

- Quick Access

- Overall Perspective

As a result, I began compressing my notes into as compact a form as I could, while still retaining the information needed to have an intuitive understanding of the material.  

Since I tend to share these with my classmates, I figured it would be a good idea to have an updated repository available to those who wish to access the latest versions of these notes.

### Curriculum

These compendia are likely relevant in many Physics, Mathematics and Engineering courses, but are specifically designed for the curriculum in the [Physics and Astronomy](http://www.uio.no/studier/program/fysikk-astronomi/) Undergraduate Program at the [University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no/).
