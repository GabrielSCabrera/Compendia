a < b           a is less than b
a > b           a is greater than b
a <= b          a is less than or equal to b
a >= b          a is greater than or equal to b
a == b          a is equal to b
a != b          a is not equal to b
a is b          a has the same object identity as b
a is not b      a doesn't have the same object identity as b

You can also use 'and' & 'or' to combine expressions,  for example
