#IMPORTANT RULES REGARDING self (taken from textbook):

''' Any class method must have 'self' as first argument

    'self' represents an arbitrary instance of the class

    To access any class attribute inside class methods, we must
    prefix with 'self' as in 'self.name', where 'name' is the
    name of the attribute

    'self' is dropped as argument in calls to class methods'''
